# javascript-Final-Project
This project has one dependency and that is 'json-server'. To install all dependencies just run:
```
npm install
```
To run the json-server and point it to the correct file, run the following command:
```
npm start
```

This webapp requires that json-server is running as changes and teams are hosted on the mock server.
